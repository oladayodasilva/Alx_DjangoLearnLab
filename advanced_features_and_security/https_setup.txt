HTTPS Deployment Notes:

To deploy the Django application securely with HTTPS:
1. Install an SSL/TLS certificate using Let’s Encrypt or another provider.
2. Configure the web server (Nginx or Apache) to:
   - Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
   - Serve the certificate and key files.
   - Forward HTTPS headers (X-Forwarded-Proto) to Django when using reverse proxy.
3. Ensure Django's SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT is enabled to force HTTPS internally.
4. Ensure SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE and CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE are enabled.
